# Voting verifier
In an hypothetical world, where e-voting systems are used, the need for individual verifiability is born.
This repo provides an independent implementation to do some verification for an imaginary e-voting system.

# Installation
Note: the program has no input validation. Wrong input or validation exceptions results in the crash of the application.

## Linux
install python, run "python main.py"

## Android
install python, buildozer (via pip), all its dependencies (see their wiki), get adb working, run "buildozer android debug deploy"
